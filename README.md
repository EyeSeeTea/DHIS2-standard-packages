# Malaria
Malaria configuration packages are available for burden reduction and elimination settings. For each of these, two configuration packages are available: an aggregate configuration packages that includes data collection and dashboards, and a dashboard configuration package that includes dashboards only.

The [malaria system design document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lySFEXnJJ-N78kycXr4SEEEXju0cGnWMpg9Dt9mk81Y) describes how the standard configuration for malaria has been configured in DHIS2. The [Change log](https://who.dhis2.org/documentation/changelog_mal.html) describes changes between each version.
