# WHO Configuration Packages for DHIS2
The WHO configuration packages consist of DHIS2 metadata that provide standard configurations of DHIS2 that allow for the collection of health data following WHO recommendations. 

# Entomology and Vector Control
Generic DHIS2 modules have been developed to strengthen the collection, reporting and use of malaria entomology and vector control data to inform decision-making. All the modules have been designed in line with existing WHO standard protocols and guidance.
This modules complement already existing [modules for malaria epidemiology](https://who.dhis2.org/documentation/index.html#malaria).

The modules consist consist of event programs and dashboards to support the collection of data from the following activities:
  * insecticide treated nets (ITN) mass distribution campaigns, 
  * ITN bioefficacy monitoring, 
  * indoor residual spraying (IRS) campaigns, 
  * IRS residual efficacy monitoring, 
  * insecticide resistance monitoring, 
  * adult mosquito surveillance and identification, including individual mosquito laboratory results
  * monitoring of mosquito larval habitats.

A [demo of the modules] (https://extranet.who.int/dhis2-ento-vc) is available in french and english.

More information on the modules and the tools designed to facilitate their implementation can be found in [this page] (https://www.who.int/teams/global-malaria-programme/prevention/vector-control/dhis-data-collection-and-collation-tools)

The latest version of the metadata packages compatible with different DHIS2 versions are available for download in the tables below. If you have questions or difficulties implementing these modules, please contact fernandezl@who.int
